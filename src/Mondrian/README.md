This extension adds custom editor with reads `*.tracealloc.json` files and provides graphical viewer for allocation trace data with ability to choose a specific memory segment.

### Viewer UI description

* Top scrollbar allows to choose viewport boundaries by dragging its edges with a mouse. It allows to open very large models by limiting rendering to selected area.
* Status bar shows information about memory blocks on hover: node origin, block size and lifetime. It also contains memory segment selector on the right.

  * `size`: memory segment size in bytes.
  * `allocations`: array of memory allocated zones with dimenstions and lifetimes:
    * `offset`: allocated memory zone offset in bytes.
    * `size`: allocated memory zone size in bytes.
    * `alive_from`: initial allocation lifetime position.
