# Design

`ONE-vscode`'s Backend api is a kind of spec to be filled with values by each supporter's define.

`ONE-vscode-backend`'s Backend supporter(implementor) is filling the value of the spec.

`ONE-vscode-backend`'s Backend implement's responsibility is just filling the value. It doesn't have tasks like `run`. It just passes *** How to Run ***.

`ONE-vscode`'s backend has all of responsibility excluding the filling task.
